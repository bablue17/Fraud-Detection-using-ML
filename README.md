# Fraud-Detection-using-ML

**Dataset**-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekbhardwaj/fraud-detection
**Problem Overview**:
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a reliable fraud detection model using supervised learning classification techniques. The model will analyze historical transaction data, identifying patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent activities, and use this information to classify new transactions as either "fraudulent" or "non-fraudulent."

**Project Components:
Dataset Exploration:**

Understand the structure of the provided dataset.
Explore key features, data types, and potential patterns.
Identify any missing or inconsistent data.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and other data inconsistencies.
Normalize or scale numerical features.
Encode categorical variables.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features that might contribute to fraud detection.
Consider creating new features or transforming existing ones.
Model Selection:

Choose suitable classification algorithms for fraud detection.
Evaluate different models based on performance metrics.
Model Training:

Train the selected model using the training dataset.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using the testing dataset.
Analyze performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Interpretation:

Interpret the model's decisions and identify key features influencing predictions.
Understand how the model distinguishes between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
